# Overview

This is a Java app built in Android Studio. This is my first android app and so the scope of this app is relatively small but it was an amazing learning experience to become fairly familiar with android app development.

This app is a simple countdown app. The simple interface allows you to pick a date that you may be anticipation and the app will show the countdown in days, hours, minutes and seconds.

The hope with this app was to build something useful yet simple and robust.
